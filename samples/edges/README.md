*edges* sample
--------------
This sample demonstrates how to obtain edge masks using an edge detector algorithm, either with a full detection sensitivity threshold sweep (i.e. with "confidence" levels), or with a single hard-coded threshold. The only required input (the image) is located in the samples' data directory. See the [source code](./src/main.cpp) comments for more details.
