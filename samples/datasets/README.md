*datasets* sample
-----------------
This sample demonstrates how to set up custom datasets to be used with a litiv algorithm (in this case, an edge detector), and how to declare & use specialized dataset implementations. All the data required here is already located in the samples' data directory. See the [source code](./src/main.cpp) comments for more details.

For more examples of specialized dataset implementations, see the [impl](../../modules/datasets/include/litiv/datasets/impl/) folder in the *datasets* module.
