The full version of the BSDS500 dataset & utilities can be found at :

http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html

This dataset was introduced by Arbel√°ez et al. in "Contour detection and
hierarchical image segmentation" (TPAMI 2011). It is provided without (!!)
a license (as of October 2015); here, we reuse a thinned & cleaned version
of its utilities to reproduce its evaluation method, since the GT comparison
approach it follows is... somewhat complex.
