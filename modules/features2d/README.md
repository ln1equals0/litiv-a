LITIV *features2d* Module
-------------------------
For now, this module only contains a feature descriptor class for Local Binary Similarity Patterns (LBSPs, [CRV2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CRV.2013.29)). These features can be used for dense image description (e.g. texture analysis) or keypoint-based description. If SSE2+ is available, intrinsics will automatically be used to drastically accelerate their computation.

Besides, an implementation of Felzenszwalbâ€™s HOG features with proper optimization under an OpenCV interface should eventually be added to this module.
