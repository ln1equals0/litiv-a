LITIV Applications
------------------
The projects in this directory use the LITIV API & modules to evaluate various computer vision algorithms. The code here is very dense, and mostly uncommented (except maybe for the VPTZ apps), as it mostly consists of benchmarks and sandboxes. For an easier introduction to the framework, see the [*samples*](../samples/).

Note that most of the applications here expect to find specific datasets in the external data root folder (as defined by the **EXTERNAL_DATA_ROOT** CMake variable); you must download these datasets yourself and restructure them (if needed by the parser). More details can be found in each application's source code.
